## Release 4: Design your own Schema
Description of what you're modeling: This is an idea I've had about an application that would track the restaurants you've eaten at. This app would require that every restaurant in Chicago be uploaded into the DB. A user would have an id, and could eat at a place of their chosing. One user can eat at many place and one resturant can have one id. I understand that this similar to many apps out there, but it's a primitave idea that would be different from what is out there. I want it to focus more on eating data. What and where you've eaten. Since there are so many places to eat in Chicago, it'd be fun to track everywhere you've eaten, and what you got.
