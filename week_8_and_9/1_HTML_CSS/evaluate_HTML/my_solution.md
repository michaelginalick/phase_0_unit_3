## Evaluate a Website! 
 
1) How does this website follow HTML Best Practices? Are there any places where 
it does not?  Provide examples of the "bad" code.
 
 1) One way that it follows HTML best practices is that it has the css href located in the <head> section. This will ensure that the style sheet is loaded more quickly.
 1A) After looking over the resource material for this challenge, the fist thing that jumped out at me is the javascript located in the HTML. This code should be located in the javascript folder and referenced in the HTML. The table is also defined within the HTML. According to the reading, this should be done in the CSS as well.
 
 
 
2) What do you think of the HTML? Did the writers use IDs and Classes properly? I feel like they did use IDs and classes properly.

Did you like the way they used HTML tags?  Please use examples with your arguments.
 2) since the site is a giant table, there's a lot of tr,td, and table tags. Although it might be correct, I wonder if they 
 could be defined in the CSS.
 
3) How did the authors handle formatting? Did they include it in the HTML or 
separate it into a CSS file? Or did they do both?  Again, include examples.
 
  3) It looks like they seperated it into the CSS, which I feel is the correct way to reder the page. The formate is defined in a class which is easy to read, and well noted.
  
4) Did the authors include anything you didn't immediately understand? 
If so, what? 4) The javascript in the HTML doesn't look immediately understandable. As well as some of the pagebreak classes
 
5) How did the authors organize the CSS file? Was it DRY?
 5) The CSS is very readable, and well organized. It's very dry, which I think is the goal. More notes might be helpfull.
 
6) Did the authors incorporate any responsive design into the site?
   6) Yes, the 180rotate class will recognize the browser.
7) What are your overall thoughts on the HTML/CSS from this website based on 
what you've read? I like the CSS overall, it's clean, easy to read, and understandable. It could be more detailed with notes about the section on the site the classes are referring to, but overall, it's good. The HTML is very busy with table tags. It seems very repetitive. I'm unsure if there is a better way to do this, if not, I guess it's the only way.
